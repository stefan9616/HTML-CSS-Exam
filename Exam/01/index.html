                    <p>Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do that,
                        but
                        great
                        minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.</p>

                    <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual
                        accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to
                        attain
                        uncommon
                        results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company work,

                        society
